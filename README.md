## Neovim

![nvim](./images/nvim.png)

I currently use [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.org) as a base for my Neovim config and followed a guide from [@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog) to make it more personalised for me,

## Zsh Shell

![zsh](./images/zsh.png)

I have switched from Fish to Zsh as it is POSIX compliant and I never run into
any issues while dealing with shell scripts. All the features that were present
in Fish have been ported to Zsh using community plugins.

## Fish Shell

![fish](./images/FishWorkflow.png)

The config remains same as my old one, nothing's changed since I don't use Fish
anymore and have switched to Zsh.

- [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) - Plugin manager
- [Tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) - Shell theme. Use version 5:
  `fisher install ilancosman/tide@v5`
- [Nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) - Powerline-patched
  fonts. I use Hack.
- [z for fish](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z) - Directory jumping
- [nvm for fish](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish) - Locally manage
  multiple versions of NodeJS

## PowerShell

The PowerShell config has also not changed at all. It works well enough for the
rare cases I need to use it.

  file icons

  Cmdlets for customizing the editing environment, used for autocompletion
